# BingoPartyBot

Like [BingoPartyTools](https://github.com/aphased/BingoPartyTools?tab=readme-ov-file#all-available-commands), but instead 
of being a ChatTriggers mod for a real player's main account to use with 
launching a regular instance of Minecraft, this repo  enables a dedicated bot 
account using [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer), which 
can then be provided via e.g. a dedicated server.


## How to run

TODO: fill in missing documentation


## Credits & thanks
